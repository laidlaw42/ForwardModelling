# Forward Modelling
Scripts for lab on *forward modelling* techniques as outlined by Dr. David Bouetlier.

## Notebooks
- Analytical 1D solution - Cooling of a dyke using the analytical solution.
- Finite difference 1D - Finite difference of cooling of two dykes using Forward Euler scheme (explicit).
- Finite difference 2D - Finite difference of cooling of two plutons in map view using Forward Euler scheme.

## Solutions
Parts 1 through to 3 are the solutions to the problems in the above jupyter notebooks.
Some code refactored, mostly here for future reference.
